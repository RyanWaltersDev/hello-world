# hello-world
My name is Ryan Walters and I am currently learning how to use Git command line and GitHub. 
For the last 6 months, I have been using Codecademy and No Starch Press books to learn HTML/CSS and Python.
I want to use GitHub to help keep an online record of my progress as I move through different projects.
I currently live in Georgia and manage a restaurant, but plan to find work as a full time developer once I'm ready.
